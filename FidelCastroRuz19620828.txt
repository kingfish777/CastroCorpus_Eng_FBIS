CASTRO STATEMENT--Andres Avino Soler, acting head of the Cuban mission
in the GDR, has handed to GDR Foreign Minister Bolz a statement by
Premier Fidel Castro condemning the recent Havana raid by counter-
revolutionary mercenaries of U.S. imperialism. We hold the U.S. Government
responsible for this new and cowardly attack upon our country, Castro
states. Before world opinion we condemn the aggressive plans which
imperialism is preparing against Cuba. (East Berlin ADN 1930 GMT
