CASTRO REJECTS EXCHANGE PROPOSAL FOR CHE'S REMAINS

Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1425 GMT 21 May 71 C (FOR OFFICIAL USE
ONLY)

[Excerpt] Havana, 21 May--Fidel Castro today categorically rejected the
proposal for an exchange of Maj Che Guevarra's mortal remains. The proposal
was made by the so-called "Committee of 100" based in the United States.

In an exclusive statement for PRENSA LATINA, the Cuban prime minister
replied as follows to the systematic campaign which has been conducted
recently by conterrevolutionaries based in Florida and which has had
repercussions in Bolivia:

"The proposal made 3 years ago concerning Che's mortal remains was intended
to unmask Barrientos.

"Today the situation in Bolivia is completely different. The people are
living a revolutionary process. Che's remains belong to revolutionary
America. No proposal of this kind can be accepted today. Cuba categorically
rejects it.

"We hail and support the worthy attitude of the Bolivian workers, peasants,
and students." (signed) "Fidel Castro."

The proposal made 3 years ago to which the Cuban prime minister refers in
this statement was made by Castro on 12 January 1968 in answer to Rene
Barrientos, then head of the Bolivian Government.
