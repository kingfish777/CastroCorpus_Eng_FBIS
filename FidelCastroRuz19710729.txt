But we cannot fail to express our admiration, our acknowledgement, our
confidence in the future of our youth and the future of our fatherland,
when today we are able to assert that a force of young men has become the
force with the highest productivity in Cuba in cane cutting tasks; that
this force has more than 300 millionaire canecutters; [applause] that this
force has 73 national heroes and that this force has achieved these
