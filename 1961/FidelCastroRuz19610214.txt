CASTRO PREDICTS AFRICAN UPRISING

Havana, PRENSA LATINA, in Spanish Morse to Authorized recipients, Feb. 14,
1961, 2203 GMT--E

(Excerpt)  Havana--Prime Minister Fidel Castro stated today that Africa
will rise up as a result of Congolese Premier Patrice Lumumba's
assassination.  In a statement to the evening newspaper COMBATE, Castro
asserted that the unspeakably appalling assassination of the courageous
Lumumba is the result of a mixture of imperialism, colonialism and savagery
brought about by mercenaries and puppets of imperialism and financial
monopolist companies who seek to place the peoples of the world under their
domination.  What are we to think about this assassination?  It is an act
of savagery.  It will provoke an uprising in all Africa, said the Prime
Minister.
